The Big Team Science Conference (BTSCON) aims to provide a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, race, ethnicity, caste, national origin, citizen status, age, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, body size, religion, socioeconomic status, other group status, or their intersection. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned, including being expelled without a refund.

## Purpose and Scope

This purpose of this code of conduct is to protect BTSCON event participants from harm. “Participants” are any people present at BTSCON, regardless of registration status. “Events” include conferences and other activities organized or sponsored by BTSCON.

This code of conduct may also apply to unacceptable behavior that occurs outside of BTSCON when such behavior has the potential to create a hostile climate for participants at BTSCON.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

Unacceptable behaviors include the following:

* Intimidating, harassing, lewd, demeaning, bullying, stalking, or threatening speech or actions
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Unwelcome physical contact
* Any real or implied threat of physical harm
* Sustained disruption of speakers or events (verbally or physically)
* Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviors or for participating in an investigation of such a claim
* Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviors

## Consequences

Participants who are asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Potential consequences for violations of this code of conduct include, but are not limited to: warning the offender, and expulsion from the conference with no refund, banning from future events.

## How to Make a Report

You can report a suspected code of conduct violation using the form embedded at the bottom of this page or by sending an email to the [conference email](mailto:bigteamscienceconference@gmail.com) or any member of the BTSCON organizing team. (See [Contact]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/))

All reports will be considered by the conference organizers, who will decide on appropriate action.

## Recusal

Conference organizers and any others responsible for enacting or overseeing this policy will recuse themselves if they have a significant conflict of interest, such as being a specific target of harassment, an alleged harasser, or having a close personal or professional relationship with a target or alleged harasser.
